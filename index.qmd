abstract: |
  Federal Emergency Management Administration 100-year flood risk maps are expanded across the state of Arizona using a random forest, machine learning classification utilizing eight topographic explanatory variables.
plain-language-summary: |
  Flood mapping across Arizona.
key-points:
  - FEMA 100-year flood risk maps were obtained on a county-by-county basis from National Flood Hazards map.
  - Flood risk maps were simplified to a binary output, flooded or not flooded (during a 100-year flood event).
  - Eight topographic variables were calculated or derived from the NASA 30-m Shuttle Radar Topography Mission digital elevation model as explanatory variables for the model.
  - Random forest modeling was performed in Google Earth Engine, with highly iterative hpyer-parametrization performed within the San Pedro watershed.
  - The best performing model within the San Pedro was expanded to the full study area, encompassing Arizona with 35,000 testing and training data points.
  - The resulting flood model benefited from some additional post-processing.
