Initial efforts focused on a traditional suitability analysis approach, using the analytical hierarchy process (AHP) for multi-criterion decision making, largely based on the work by @Aloui_Zghibi_Mazzoni_Elomri_Al-Ansari_2024. These methods saw initial success, and are continuing to be developed and refined. However, it became apparent that there were a number of shortcomings inherent in this analysis which are not easily addressed. \n\nFirstly, the results of such an analysis are intrinsically linked to the data layers used, and the weighting schema determined by the AHP. As additional data sets became available, and alternate weighting schemas were tested we generated multiple versions of mapped flood potential which did not necessarily agree with each other. In the absence of high quality ground-truthed data it was difficult to validate these results and it was not clear to the project team which version was the best. This underscores the need for expert involvement at every stage in these AHP based analysis. While there is a wealth of hydrological expertise within the larger ATUR project, method development and implementation has largely been conducted by a GIS technician with marginal hydrologic knowledge, and it has been difficult to foster sustained buy-in from team members on this portion of the project.\n\nFurthermore, it was extremely difficult to develop a single generalized model that would be effective across the whole state. Because of the wide array of ecological and geologic conditions that are present across the state variables that are important for flood risk in one region may not apply in other regions. Lastly, even if these technical issues could be overcome, there was still gaps in the input data layers, resulting in unclassified regions.\n\nWhile the traditional suitability analysis methods of assessing flood potential is still valuable to the project, and will be retained and developed further, the reality of these challenges lead us to reevaluate our overall approach and consider alternate methods. Work by @Mudashiru_Sabtu_Abustan_Balogun_2021 summarized the various methods used by other researchers in this field, which includes AHP based methods as well as physical modeling and machine learning applications. The machine learning methods utilized by @Tehrany_Jones_Shabani_2019 appeared to be particularly relevant and applicable. In particular, their use of topographic data **only** was particularly intriguing. These data sets are fully calculable from a digital elevation model (DEM), which are readily available, easily accessible, and have full coverage over the study area. These findings lead to a renewed initiative to apply a machine learning based method towards the objective of a state wide flooding potential map.\n\n## Data & Methods {#sec-data-methods}\n### Topography Data\nAll explanatory variables for the model were derived from the NASA Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) 30-m DEM. Slope, aspect, curvature, stream power index (SPI), topographic wetness index (TWI), and sediment transport index (STI) were all calculated in ArcGIS Pro (3.4.3). Slope, aspect and curvature were calculated using the Surface Parameters tool (Spatial Analyst). SPI, TWI, and STI were calculated as per @Tehrany_Jones_Shabani_2019 using the Raster Calculator according to Equations [-@eq-spi]-[-@eq-sti]\n\n$$\nSPI = A_s * tan(ß)\n$${#eq-spi}\n\n$$\nTWI = ln(A_s / tan(ß))\n$${#eq-twi}\n\n$$\nSTI = (A_s / 22.13)^{0.6} * (sin(ß)/0.0896)^{1.3}\n$${#eq-sti}\n\nwhere A~s~ is catchment area (m) and ß is slope (radians).\n\nSimilarly, Topographic Roughness Index (TRI) was calculated as per @Tehrany_Jones_Shabani_2019 using a custom R (4.4.1) function with the package terra (1.7-78) according to @eq-tri\n\n$$\nTRI = \\left[ \\sum (χ_{ij} - χ_{00})^2 \\right] ^{0.5}\n$${#eq-tri}\n\nwhere χ~ij~ is the elevation at coordinates (i, j) and χ~00~ is the elevation at coordinates (0, 0) for a 3x3 focal neighborhood. The code used to calculate TRI is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/travisz09/TopographicRoughnessIndex).\n\n### Flooding Data\nFlood data used for training the model was obtained from the Federal Emergency Management Administration (FEMA) National Flood Hazards Layer, which provides 100-year flood maps for many areas of the US. The data was manually downloaded for each county in AZ from the FEMA [data viewer](https://hazards-fema.maps.arcgis.com/apps/webappviewer/index.html?id=8b0adb51996444d4879338b5529aa9cd) (accessed 3/15/2025). Data layers were merged in ArcGIS Pro (3.4.3), and the vector data was converted to a raster with a 10 m resolution. Additionally, the FEMA data was reclassified to a binary output, either flooded or not flooded (during a 100-year flood event), eliminating details such as survey methods and flow depth.\n\n### Variable Collinearity\nThe machine learning model was performed in Google Earth Engine (GEE). The SRTM elevation data was access and clipped to the study area natively through GEE servers, all other data layers, including the study area shapefile, were uploaded as an asset to GEE prior to model implementation.\n\nPrior to modeling, the collinearity of the explanatory variables was explored using a series of pair-wise linear regression plots shown in Figures [@appfig-floodElev]-[@appfig-triSti]. For collinearity analysis 5,000 points (the maximum number of points which can be plotted in GEE) were randomly sampled across the study area . The collinearity of each pair-wise regression is summarized visually in @fig-Rsquared using the R-squared statistic of each comparison. While some relationships, e.g. slope and TWI, share a complex relationship that is not captured by a linear regression, the R-squared statistic is a simple indicator of collinearity which is readily understood. Although a formal variance inflation factor (VIF) analysis was not performed, efforts were made to limit model complexity by manually testing variable combinations, especially those that showed high degrees of collinearity, and at equivalent model accuracy, simpler models were preferred.\n\n![Color coded R-squared statistic for each pair-wise linear regression (green = high, red = low), representing the collinearity of each variable used for modeling.](images/CorrelationMatrix.PNG){#fig-Rsquared}\n\n### Initial Model Testing and Development\nMany models were iteratively explored using several machine learning algorithms, various combinations of explanatory variables, and many hyperparameterization values. For all initial model trials the study area was reduced to the San Pedro watershed, a well characterized watershed with approx. 66% FEMA flood map coverage (visual estimate). A 70:30::training:testing data structure was adopted, and while a range of sampled points were tested, this ratio was maintained throughout. Model performance was primarily assessed through an overall accuracy score, with confusion matrix analysis performed for highly accurate models. \n\nTested models included Classification and Regression Tree (CART, a.k.a Decision Tree), Random Forest (RF), and Support Vector Machine (SVM). Generally, CART classification produced very noisy results which tended to overestimate flood waters, and averaged around 79.5% accuracy (data not shown). SVM classification was too computationally demanding, even within the smaller study area of the San Pedro, and with the generous cloud computing resources of GEE. As a consequence SVM classification can not be evaluated, other than to say that it is inefficient and implementation is impractical. RF classification proved to be the most promising method of classification, and the most effort was spent on developing that model.\n\n#### Random Forest Model Development\nOver 400 RF models were tested for the San Pedro watershed. Model optimization parameters tested included the number of trees, the number of sampling points (from 20,000 up to 60,000), and combinations of explanatory variables. Many RF models were tested simultaneously with between 5 to 100 trees using a custom GEE function modified from @EEFA_F2.2. The referenced accuracy scores for preliminary models refers to the most accurate model, using the fewest number of trees. Tested RF models ranged from 73.9% to 87.4% (@tbl-rfAcc). The most accurate model tested used 35,000 sampling points, consisting of 30,000 dry land points (not flooded) and 5,000 flooded points and with all explanatory variables except for TRI, achieving an 87.4% overall accuracy. \n\n| Variables     | Sampling Points (dry land, flooded)      | Trees | Accuracy (%) |\n| ------------- | ------------- | ----- | ------------ |\n| All           | 15000, 5000  | 50    | 79.2     |\n| All           | 20000, 5000  | 85    | 82       |\n| All           | 20000, 10000 | 85    | 73.9     |\n| All           | 25000, 5000  | 50    | 84.8     |\n| All           | 30000, 5000  | 45    | 87       |\n| All           | 30000, 10000 | 80    | 78.9     |\n| All           | 40000, 10000 | 50    | 82.1     |\n| All           | 50000, 10000 |       | Error    |\n| No TRI        | 25000, 5000  | 90    | 84.9     |\n| No slope      | 25000, 5000  | 70    | 84.8     |\n| No TRI        | 30000, 5000  | 70    | 87.4     |\n| No TRI or STI | 30000, 5000  | 40    | 87.2     |\n| No STI        | 30000, 5000  | ??    | 87.1     |\n| No elev       | 30000, 5000  | 90    | 86.3     |\n| No slope      | 30000, 5000  | 80    | 87.2     |\n| No aspec      | 30000, 5000  | 60    | 87       |\n| No curve      | 30000, 5000  | 40    | 87.1     |\n| No SPI        | 30000, 5000  | 70    | 87.1     |\n| No TWI        | 30000, 5000  | 40    | 87.1     |\n\n: Random Forest algorithm optimization and accuracy. All recorded sampling points grouped together before being partitioned into a 70:30::training:testing structure. {#tbl-rfAcc .striped}\n\nConfusion matrix analysis for this model showed much higher producers accuracy (98.6%) compared to consumers accuracy (88.1%; @tbl-confusion1). While these results are still satisfactory, they reveal that the model is generally favoring dry land classification over flooded. This can easily be explained by the relative abundance of dry land pixels vs. flooded pixels, both in the sampling points and within the FEMA training image as a whole. Qualitatively, the model appeared to be somewhat overfit to stream channels (high SPI and STI), and while many of the larger flood plains were effectively captured, many features appeared too narrow. Additionally, the results were somewhat noisy, with noticeable speckling in both the dry and flooded regions.\n\n![The confusion for the most accurate random forest classifier, including overall,
